### Objective
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Platform as a Service (PaaS), is a cloud computing model that allows the users to develop, deploy, run and manage applications without taking care about the underlying layers. The alternatives used today focus on the use of containers which promote the **microservices based application** development approach (vs **monolithic applications**), because the different services into which we the application is separated can easily run in different containers. We will make a study of Docker, Kubernates and OpenShift in order to develop, deploy, run and manage  microservices based applications.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This activity has been developed for developing the professional competence includes in the Erasmus+ project "Cloud Computing in European Schools".

###  Initial Level
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Do this [questionnarie](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlYr6VB7r5667owEp6ux3v7762ZBXslI_jGOuB4zoLbnCRBg/viewform) to asses your initial level.  
<br><br>

### Exercise no. 1: Introduction to PaaS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Read** the [Introduction to PaaS - English version](https://iesgn.github.io/cloudandrelated/paas.html#/) or [Introducción a PaaS - Spanish version](https://iesgn.github.io/cloudandrelated/es_paas.html#/) to learn about what is PaaS, differences with SaaS and IaaS, and the big players (companies) about PaaS.
<br/><br/>

### Work methodology


 1. Collaborative team work.
 2. The class will be distributed in groups and each group have to practice the exercises proposed in this activity.
 3. The practices must be documentated.

<br/><br/>
### Documentation and meeting exhibition
 1. Only delivery for each group.
 2. **Documentation special parts**: the documentation must include the **Erasmus+ project name and number, Erasmus+ logo, IES Ramón del Valle Inclán Logo, the disclaimer**. You can find an example in this document (see above).  Other parts are: index, introduction, conclusion.
 3. The documentation must be given in **GitHub**; each group must upload their documentation to GitHub. One component from each group must use his/her GitHub account and add the others components as **collaborators**.
 4. All groups must add the teacher as another collaborator.
 5. Documentation content for each group: PENDING.
 6. After finishing the documentation, each component must **fork** into his/her Github account and publish a tweet which contain a link to this documentation.
 7. All student has to follow the **Twitter account** from the rest of class mates and retweet a tweet from, at least, one class mate.
 8. Some students must submit the documentation **in English**.
 9. Students who do the documentation in English must prepare a **1-hour workshop** to teach the rest of the students from the other participating schools. The objective of the workshop is that attendees learn the most theoretical aspects of Developing on the Cloud and doing the practices. The generated documentation must be oriented for this workshop. Suggestion: use tools such as Google Form to gather information or Kahoot to prepare interactive questions. The creativity of the presented workshop will be valued.

<br/><br/>


### Mark && Evaluation criteria evaluated
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activity serve as an improvement of the skills to develop applications on the Cloud. There are not evaluation criteria related to the professional module "Development Environments" to match to this activity. The mark of this activity  will add to the final mark of the professional module whenever the final mark is equal to or greater than 4.5 (evaluation of the associated learning results of the professional module). This activity will increase the final mark up a maximum of 1 point.
